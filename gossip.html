<!--       Taylor Swift’s best friend, known to some as Karlie Kloss, stopped by the Flatiron School to see what the students were working on. People attempted to ask her questions but usually ended up filming snapchat stories instead. Taylor Swift’s best friend was asked many personal  questions about her friendship with the pop sensation. The Flatiron teachers ended the meeting with Karlie early, so that the students could focus on some real coding.When Kloss was asked about the encounter, “I was so excited to meet these celebrities, I’ve heard so much about them! My one regret was that I was asked to leave so quickly”.  -->
