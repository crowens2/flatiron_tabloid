    <p id="story1">
      Taylor Swift’s best friend, known to some as Karlie Kloss, stopped by the Flatiron School to see what the students were working on. People attempted to ask her questions but usually ended up filming snapchat stories instead. Taylor Swift’s best friend was asked many personal  questions about her friendship with the pop sensation. The Flatiron teachers ended the meeting with Karlie early, so that the students could focus on some real coding.When Kloss was asked about the encounter, “I was so excited to meet these celebrities, I’ve heard so much about them! My one regret was that I was asked to leave so quickly”.

    <p id="story1">After a long and successful run at the FlatIron school, Ayaan is gone.  Disappeared into thin air.  Well actually, more like he disappeared into vacation.  Ayaan, also known as the boy wonder, attended the software engineering class as well.  He was known for his jokes and his unusual comments when everyone else was quiet.  Some say he disappeared due to the pressure of the      tabloid and catering to the vicious audience.  Some say he decided to pursue his passion of underwater basket-weaving.  The world may never know.
